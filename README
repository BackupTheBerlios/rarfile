3. History
----------

Version 2.0 (2010-04-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Features::
 * Python 3 support.  Still works with 2.x.
 * Parses extended time fields. (.mtime, .ctime, .atime)
 * .open() method.  This makes possible to process large
   entries that do not fit into memory.
 * Supports password-protected archives.
 * Supports archive comments.

Cleanups::
 * Uses subprocess module to launch unrar.
 * .filename is always Unicode string, .unicode_filename is now deprecated.
 * .CRC is unsigned again, as python3 crc32() is unsigned.

Version 1.1 (2008-08-31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes::
 * Replace os.tempnam() with tempfile.mkstemp().  (Jason Moiron)
 * Fix infinite loop in _extract_hack on unexpected EOF
 * RarInfo.CRC is now signed value to match crc32()
 * RarFile.read() now checks file crc

Cleanups::
 * more docstrings
 * throw proper exceptions (subclasses of rarfile.Error)
 * RarInfo has fields pre-initialized, so they appear in help()
 * rename RarInfo.data to RarInfo.header_data
 * dont use "print" when header parsing fails
 * use try/finally to delete temp rar

Version 1.0 (2005-08-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
