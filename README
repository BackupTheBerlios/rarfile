rarfile - Rar archive reader for Python
=======================================

1.  Description
----------------

This is Python module for Rar archive reading.  The interface
is made as `zipfile` like as possible.

Features:

- Supports RAR 3.x archives.
- Supports multi volume archives.
- Supports Unicode filenames.
- Handles non-compressed files without outside help.
- For compressed files runs `unrar` utility.

Missing features:

- Password-protected archives.
- Comment handling. (archive, file)
- Decompression through unrarlib and/or unrar.dll.
- extract_with_hack on multi-volume archives

Personally, I have no need for those, so ...
