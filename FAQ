rarfile FAQ
===========

Will rarfile support wrapping unrarlib/unrar.dll/unrar.so in the future?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No.  The current architecture - parsing in Python and decompression with
command line tools work well across all interesting operating systems
(Windows/Linux/MacOS), wrapping a library does not bring any advantages.

Simple execution of command-line tools is also legally simpler situation
than linking with external library.

How can I get it work on Windows?
---------------------------------

On Windows the ``unrar.exe`` is not in ``PATH`` so simple ``Popen("unrar ..")`` does not work.
It can be solved several ways:

1. Add location of ``unrar.exe`` to PATH.
2. Set rarfile.UNRAR_TOOL to full path of ``unrar.exe``.
3. Copy ``unrar.exe`` to your program directory.
4. Copy ``unrar.exe`` to system directory that is in PATH, eg. ``C:\Windows``.

How to avoid the need for user to manually install rarfile/unrar?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Include ``rarfile.py`` and/or ``unrar`` with your application.

Will it support creating RAR archives?
--------------------------------------

There are 2 ways rarfile could do it - either wrap ``rar`` tool
or create non-compressed archives with pure Python code.

But RARLAB_ licenses seem to allow neither one, so until there is
some clarification what is allowed, I won't include writing code.

In the meantime use either Zip_ (better compatibility) or 7z_ (better compression)
format for your own archives.
